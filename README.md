The chosen topic for this web scraping project is to gather information about Indian 
startups. This data oAers valuable insights into the entrepreneurial landscape, enabling 
analyses of trends such as funding, employment growth, and the industries driving 
innovation in India.

startup case studies, oAering comprehensive information about their journeys, 
challenges, and successes. 
The extracted data includes essential attributes such as the startup name, description, 
founding year, founders' names, industries they belong to, employee count, and funding 
details. These attributes are vital for understanding a startup’s profile and its impact 
within the startup ecosystem. 
The extracted data is relevant because of its potential applications. For instance, it can be 
used by investors to identify promising startups, by researchers to analyze industry trends, 
or by aspiring entrepreneurs to learn from others’ experiences. By automating the data 
collection process, this project demonstrates the power of web scraping in eAiciently 
gathering structured data from online sources for strategic and analytical purposes. 
This project demonstrates an application of web scraping in practical terms while being a 
meaningful contribution to the dynamic startup ecosystem of India.
